# WSAXternDS

**Project Summary**

This repository consists of three files: A CSV file, a Jupyter Notebook file, and a README. "2025-VeloCityX-Expanded-Fan-Engagement-Data.csv" is the name of the CSV file. This file contains a sample dataset of the interactions of 100 users on a fictional autonomous racing platform named VeloCityX. The Jupyter Notebook file named "WSADataScience_SeanVandenBussche.ipynb," contains the cleaned dataset from the CSV file and visual analysis and insights drawn from the dataframe created of the dataset using Pandas and matplotlib in Python. The Python code cells must be run in order from top to bottom, as cells will refer to code from previous cells throughout the file.
