**Project Summary**

This repository consists of three files: A CSV file, a Jupyter Notebook file, and a README. "2025-VeloCityX-Expanded-Fan-Engagement-Data.csv" is the name of the CSV file. This file contains a sample dataset of the interactions of 100 users on a fictional autonomous racing platform named VeloCityX. The Jupyter Notebook file named "WSADataScience_SeanVandenBussche.ipynb," contains the cleaned dataset from the CSV file and visual analysis and insights drawn from the dataframe created of the dataset using Pandas and matplotlib in Python.
